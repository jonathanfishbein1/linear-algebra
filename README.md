# Linear Algebra

## Summary

A module for vector and matrix operations

The vector and matrix types are parameterized allowing for matricies and vectors composed of any type including Ints, Floats, Complex numbers or even Strings.  However, the majority of this package's functionality is geared towards working with Real numbers and Complex Numbers from [jonathanfishbein1/complex-numbers](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jonathanfishbein1/complex-numbers/latest/).

While the other Elm lienar algebra packages are geared towards graphics, this linear algebra package is geared more towards solving systems of linear equations and manipulating matrices into different forms including Reduced Row Echelon Form.
